# What is React
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Declarative

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

### Component-Based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

```js

class PageHeader extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>{this.props.content}</h1>
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: <PageHeader content="Home" />

```

Here, `PageHeader` is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters, called `props`, and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the `render` method. The `render` method returns a description of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen.
