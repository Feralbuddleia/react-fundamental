# Arrow Function

* No this, super, arguments, and new.target bindings - The value of this, super, arguments, and new.target inside of the function is by the closest containing nonarrow function.
* Cannot be called with new - Arrow functions do not have a [[Construct]] method and therefore cannot be used as constructors. Arrow functions throw an error when used with new.
* No prototype - since you can’t use new on an arrow function, there’s no need for a prototype. The prototype property of an arrow function doesn’t exist.
* Can’t change this - The value of this inside of the function can’t be changed. It remains the same throughout the entire lifecycle of the function.
* No arguments object - Since arrow functions have no arguments binding, you must rely on named and rest parameters to access function arguments.
* No duplicate named parameters - arrow functions cannot have duplicate named parameters in strict or nonstrict mode, as opposed to nonarrow functions that cannot have duplicate named parameters only in strict mode.

### Syntax

```js
let sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

// effectively equivalent to:

let sum = (num1, num2) => {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// effectively equivalent to:

let sum = function(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
};
```

### this

```js

function run() {
  this.name = 'React';
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }, 3000);
}

run(); // undefined

```

```js

function run() {
  this.name = 'React';
  var that = this;
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(that.name);
  }, 3000);
}

run(); // React

```

```js

function run() {
  this.name = 'React';
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }, 3000);
}

run(); // React

```
