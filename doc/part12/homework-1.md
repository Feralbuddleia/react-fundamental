# Homework One

This homework is a followup version of [Homework Four](../part11/homework-4.md) in last React section. In this homework, we need to rewrite some of the part using React Router.

* Write a route and a component for route `/`, simply showing some text like `Home Page`.
* Write a route and a component for route `/users`, show the user list UI on this route.
* Write a route and a component for route `/users/:login`, showing the user detail for a specific user on this route, based on the github login name. Also in this page of `/users/:login`, you should have a button to go back to route `/users`.
