# Q & A

Here is a list of the most common question and the most confusing part people will have based on my experience.

### Do we really need to split a single HTML element into a tiny React component?

You don't need to that for most of the cases, unless there is a specific reason.

### What is the best way to struture the code for a React project?

* Use directory for component, and use `index.js` as the entry point.
* Make every component fully seperated.
* Make component reusable.
