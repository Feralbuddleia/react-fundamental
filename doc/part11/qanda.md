# Q & A

Here is a list of the most common question and the most confusing part people will have based on my experience.

### Do we really need to split a single HTML element into a tiny React component?

You don't need to that for most of the cases, unless there is a specific reason.

### What is the best way to struture the code for a React project?

* Use directory for component, and use `index.js` as the entry point.
* Make every component fully seperated.
* Make component reusable.

### How to use other React libraries in my React project?

* UI
  * https://material-ui.com
  * https://react-bootstrap.github.io
  * https://ant.design
* Animation
  * http://react-spring.surge.sh
* Charts
  * http://recharts.org/#/en-US/
  * https://github.com/hshoff/vx
* Other

### Best way to initialize state in React component

```js
// first way
class A extends Component {
  state = {number: 1};
}

// second way
class B extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {number: 1};
  }
}
```

* No difference for most of the time.
* The first syntax is in a further stage of ECMAScript, so that it's unstable when comparing with the second one.
  * http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6
  * https://babeljs.io/docs/en
* All the official doc uses the second way
* Although we use the same syntax to define functiosn inside component, state is a little special.
* Based on those points, you are not required to use a specific one. But personally I recommand the second one.

### Why we use immutable data in React?

Short answer: to have a better performance.

* There are two major types of equality check in Javascript: shallow equality check vs deep equality check.
* A shallow equility check means that JS only checks that the valueâ€™s object ids are the same, not that their content is the same. The id here means the memory affress for where JS stores the information for that particular object.
* A deep equality check means that JS will check if two values are exactly the same.

A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. In JavaScript, there are 6 primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015).

All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.

```js
// Using a string method doesn't mutate the string
var bar = 'baz';
console.log(bar); // baz
bar.toUpperCase();
console.log(bar); // baz

// Using an array method mutates the array
var foo = [];
console.log(foo); // []
foo.push('plugh');
console.log(foo); // ["plugh"]

// Assignment gives the primitive a new (not a mutated) value
bar = bar.toUpperCase(); // BAZ
```

In React, the render function will be called if there is any udpate in `state` or `props`. Think about how can we tell if there is an udpate or not.

* Deep check: loop all the data to see if there is any difference
* Shallow check: check if they are in the same memory location

```js
const data = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  data.push(1);
}
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {data};
  }

  changeData = () => {
    this.state.data[4000] = 2;
  };

  changeDataTheBetterWay = () => {
    const data = this.state.data;
    data[4000] = 2;
    this.setState({data});
  };

  render() {
    //...
  }
}
```
